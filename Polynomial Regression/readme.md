We need to use polynomial when both the linear and multiple doesn’t get accurate plot line for this. If most of the data not fits in the regressor predict line, use this model.
Works on any size of dataset, works very well on non linear problems. Although, we need to choose the right polynomial degree for a good bias/variance tradeoff

y= b0 + b1x1ˆ1 + b2x1ˆ2 … + bnx1ˆn

Linearity always links up the co-efficient and the constant and not to the x and y values.
