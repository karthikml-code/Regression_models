This model uses a regressor tube instead of a regressor line. Epsilon is the scalable variable used for SVM models. And based on that the predictions on the independent and dependent variables are happening implicitly. It doesnâ€™t have an explicit equation like other regression.
Svm kernel functions are used on the non-linear svr model. The most common svl kernel function is gaussian radial basis function(RBF).
Feature scaling is very important in SVR. Also we need to reverse transform them while doing predictions and regressor lines.


Easily adaptable, works very well on non linear problems, not biased by outliers. 
Compulsory to apply feature scaling, not well known, more difficult to understand
