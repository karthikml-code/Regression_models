CART – classification trees and regression trees

The scatter plot of the dataset is split into many slices by the algorithm and each of them have a different average which acts in the prediction method. This way we will be able to build the decision tree for the dataset. No feature scaling is required here. We need to only fill the null records.
DecisionTreeRegressor – used to predict for continuous numerical values.

Interpretability, no need for feature scaling, works on both linear / nonlinear problems.
Poor results on too small datasets, overfitting can easily occur
